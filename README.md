# Reflection

## Existing libraries that offer reflection

* Boost.Hana: This is a header-only library that provides high-level algorithms to manipulate heterogeneous collections and provides compile-time reflection capabilities.
* RTTR (Run Time Type Reflection): This library allows you to add reflection capabilities to your C++ code. It supports querying and manipulating type information at runtime.
* Ponder: This library provides runtime reflection for C++ and was inspired by the C# reflection API. It allows you to access type information and interact with objects at runtime.
* CppReflect: This is a lightweight, header-only library that provides static reflection for C++. It uses a preprocessor to generate metadata about your types.
* Tinyrefl: A minimal, header-only C++ static reflection API and tool. It uses the Clang libTooling to parse the C++ code and generate metadata.
* magic_get: Part of Boost, this library provides structured bindings to access tuple-like objects. It can be used to implement a form of compile-time reflection.
